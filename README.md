# The Devourer

**The world’s a cruel place. In the end, we’re all just meat.**

Leo Winfield has always felt like something was missing. When snow falls over Los Angeles—a rare, almost haunting scene—it pulls him back to the day his sister was killed by a monstrous fiend. Now, with survivor's guilt gnawing at his will and a hardened indifference chilling his every step, Leo’s only goal is to survive in a city as brutal and uncaring as the creatures lurking within it. But one night, everything changes. Returning home, he finds his family slaughtered by a fiend, and as he tries to fight back, the unthinkable happens: **he becomes the monster that kills him**.

In this nightmare reality, Leo is thrust into a shadow world where fiends walk among humans, each harboring its own history, instincts, and secrets. The lines between predator and prey blur as Leo learns that these creatures are more than mindless beasts—they are survivors, living in the shadows of humanity. Forced to face the fractured, violent minds now vying for control within him, Leo becomes ensnared in a battle not just for survival, but for his own identity.

Hunted by the same humans he once trusted, Leo is trapped in a twisted game he never wanted to play. With every choice, he strays further from the person he once was, leaving him to confront one terrifying question: **in a world full of monsters, what does it mean to be human?**
